        <h2>Ben</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I currently work as a draftsmen/fabricator for a company in the Salt Lake Area. 
            My wife and I have been married for nearly a year 
            and we love to go to the movies (or our living room, COVID-19 style) and eat lots of popcorn.
        <p>
            Currently, I run the fabrication department of a truck and trailer shop and I am pursuing
            a B.S. in Applied Technology. I love the flexibility and Christ-centered focus of BYU-I. It has helped  
            me to grow in my faith.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am taking this course as part of my degree. The future of the economy is going to be increasingly
            web-based and I want to be on the cutting edge of that technology. Additionally, I hope that
            I can take the skills I learn here and apply them to my job in some way. I also would like
            to help my wife with increasing the online presence of her waxing business. 
        <p>
            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my entire life. It has challenged me and helped to
            find peace in a challenging world. One of my favorite scriptures is 3 Nephi 27:27, when  
            Christ says, "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even  
            as I am." I often come back to these words when I am reviewing my life and seeking to find
            a happier path.
