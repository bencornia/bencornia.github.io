        <p>
            Hello! I currently work as a draftsmen/fabricator for a company in the Salt Lake Area. 
            My wife and I have been married for almost 2 years
            and we love to go to the movies (or our living room, COVID-19 style) and eat lots of popcorn.
        <p>
            Currently, I run the fabrication department of a truck and trailer shop and I am pursuing
            a B.S. in Applied Technology. I love the flexibility and Christ-centered focus of BYU-I. It has helped  
            me to increase my skills and career opportunities.
